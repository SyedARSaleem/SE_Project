Unit tests are designed to test a single unit of code in isolation from the rest of the application. This means that dependencies such as external systems, databases, or other modules are typically mocked or stubbed out.
Unit tests focus on testing small units of code, such as functions, methods, or classes. By breaking down the software into small testable units, it becomes easier to identify and isolate defects.
Unit tests are automated tests that can be run quickly and easily, typically as part of a continuous integration (CI) process. Automated testing ensures that unit tests can be executed frequently without manual intervention.
Unit tests should produce consistent and repeatable results. This allows developers to verify the behavior of individual units of code reliably, even after changes have been made to the codebase.
Since unit tests focus on testing small units of code in isolation, they are generally fast to execute. This enables developers to run tests frequently during the development process without significant overhead.
Unit tests are often considered a form of white-box testing, as they require knowledge of the internal workings of the code being tested. Developers write unit tests based on their understanding of the code's logic and structure.
Unit tests typically include assertions that verify the expected behavior of the unit under test. These assertions compare the actual output of the unit with the expected output and fail the test if they do not match.
